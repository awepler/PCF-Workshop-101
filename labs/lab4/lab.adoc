= Lab 4 - Monitoring your Application

[abstract]
--
Pivotal Cloudfoundry makes the work of performing operations actions, such as scaling, doing a zero-downtime deploy, and managing application health very easy.
In the this labs we'll continue to explore Pivotal Cloudfoundry application operations.

== Tailing Application Logs

One of the most important enablers of visibility into application behavior is logging.
Effective management of logs has historically been very difficult.
Cloud Foundry's https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator[log aggregation] components simplify log management by assuming responsibility for it.
Application developers need only log all messages to either `STDOUT` or `STDERR`, and the platform will capture these messages.

=== For Developers

Application developers can view application logs using the CF CLI.

. Let's view recent log messages for the application.  For this lab you can use the Java, Ruby, or Node.js sample app.  In each of the commands below replace _spring-music_ with the name of your deployed application:
+
----
$ cf logs spring-music --recent
----
+
Here are two interesting subsets of one output from that command:

As you can see, Cloud Foundry's log aggregation components capture both application logs and CF component logs relevant to your application.
These events are properly interleaved based on time, giving you an accurate picture of events as they transpired across the system.

. To get a running ``tail'' of the application logs rather than a dump, simply type:
+
----
$ cf logs spring-music
----
+
You can try various things like refreshing the browser and triggering stop/start events to see logs being generated.

=== For Operators (OPTIONAL)

Application operators will also enjoy commands like `cf logs`, but are often interested in long-term retention, indexing, and analysis of logs as well.
Cloud Foundry currently only provides short-term retention of logs.
To meet these needs, Cloud Foundry provides the ability to http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/log-management.html[drain logs to third-party providers.]

In this section, we'll drain logs to a very simple provider called https://papertrailapp.com[Papertrail].

. Visit https://papertrailapp.com and create a free account.

. Login to your account and add your first system:
+
image::papertrail_1.png[]

. Click on ``Heroku'':
+
image::papertrail_2.png[]

. Choose ``I use Heroku'' and provide a name:
+
image::papertrail_3.png[]

. Note the URL + Port assigned to your application:
+
image::papertrail_4.png[]

. We'll use a Cloud Foundry http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html[user-provided service instance] to create the log drain for our application using the URL + Port provided by Papertrail:
+
----
$ cf cups spring-music-logs -l syslog://logs2.papertrailapp.com:43882
Creating user provided spring-music-logs in org pivot-awepler / space development as awepler@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. We bind that service instance into our application
+
----
$ cf bind-service workshop workshop-logs
Binding service spring-music-logs to app workshop in org pivot-awepler / space development as awepler@pivotal.io...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage workshop' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. We'll use a `cf restart` rather than `cf restage` to make the binding take effect:
+
----
$ cf restart spring-music
----

. Navigate to the home Dashboard of the Papertrail app and select your 'system' to see log events immediately flowing to the log viewing page:
+
image::papertrail_5.png[]

You can see how to connect to other third-party log management systems in the http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/log-management-thirdparty-svc.html[Cloud Foundry documentation].

== Viewing Application _Events_

Cloud Foundry only allows application configuration to be modified via its API.
This gives application operators confidence that all changes to application configuration are known and auditable.
It also reduces the number of causes that must be considered when problems arise.

All application configuration changes are recorded as _events_.
These events can be viewed via the Cloud Foundry API, and viewing is facilitated via the CLI.

Take a look at the events that have transpired so far for our deployment of `workshop`:

<1> Events are sorted newest to oldest, so we'll start from the bottom.
Here we see the `app.create` event, which created our application's record and stored all of its metadata (e.g. `memory: 512`).
<2> The `app.map-route` event records the incoming request to assign a route to our application.
<3> This `app.update` event records the resulting change to our applications metadata.
<4> This `app.update` event records the change of our application's state to `STARTED`.
<5> Remember scaling the application up? This `app.update` event records the metadata change `instances: 5`.
<6> And here's the `app.crash` event recording that we encountered a crash of an application instance.

. Let's explicitly ask for the application to be stopped:
